In this Project I have made a Django app in which we can see the job listings which are web scrapped from Indeed Website.Then users can visit /admin page and can enter via 
username and password which is sapan ans 123 respectively.There on djano administartion they can serach for a job,delete it and can edit it.There they can also see the average of
the salary of their city using the numpy libraray.
